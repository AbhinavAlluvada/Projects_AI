About the Sentiment Analysis Model

This is a pretrained sentiment analysis model from Hugging Face.
Internally, it is based on a Transformer neural network trained on large amounts of text.

The model reads a sentence and classifies it as POSITIVE or NEGATIVE by understanding word meaning and context, not just keywords.

You are not training it from scratch; you are using learned knowledge and applying rules on top of it to change behavior.

This is the same type of model used in chatbots, reviews analysis, and social media monitoring.
