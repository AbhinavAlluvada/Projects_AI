1. The import brings in the high-level `pipeline` utility, which bundles model loading, tokenization, inference, and output formatting into a single callable component.
2. Creating `pipeline("sentiment-analysis")` loads a pre-trained sentiment classifier—usually a DistilBERT model fine-tuned on SST-2—and prepares it for direct text input without any manual preprocessing.
3. The variable `text` stores the raw sentence that will be analyzed, and the pipeline internally handles conversion into tokens the model can understand.
4. Calling `classifier(text)` sends the string through tokenization, feeds the encoded form into the model, converts model logits into probabilities, and returns a list of prediction dictionaries.
5. The print statements extract the predicted sentiment label and its confidence score from the first element of the result list, displaying them alongside the original text.
